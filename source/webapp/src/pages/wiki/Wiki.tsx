                                            <p>The NTRU lattice is a promising candidate to construct practical
                                                cryptosystems
                                                resistant to quantum computing attacks, and particularly plays a leading
                                                role in
                                                the ongoing NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization. On one hand,

                                                consideration
                                                when deploying PQC algorithms in reality. Nevertheless, there are still

                                            <p> To address these issues, we will be covering several implementations of

                                            <p> It demonstrates a new approach to decrypting NTRU ciphertext, where the
                                                plaintext message is recovered with the aid of our decoding algorithm in
                                                the
                                                scalable E8 lattice (instead of eliminating the extra terms modulo ùëù in
                                                traditional NTRU-based KEM schemes). The instantiation of CTRU is over

                                            <p> According to the research on CTRU, it is the most bandwidth efficient
                                                KEM
                                                based
                                                on the NTRU lattice up to now. In addition, roughly speaking, compared
                                                to
                                                other
                                                NTRU-based KEM schemes, CTRU has
                                                stronger security against known attacks, enjoys more robust CCA security
                                                reduction (starting from IND-CPA rather than OW-CPA), and its
                                                encapsulation
                                                and
                                                decapsulation processes are also among
                                                the most efficient. For example, when compared to the NIST Round 3
                                                finalist
                                                NTRU-HRSS, our CTRU-768 has 15% smaller ciphertext size and its security
                                                is
                                                strengthened by (45, 40) bits for classical and quantum security
                                                respectively.</p>
                                            <p> When compared to Kyber, CTRU has both smaller bandwidth and lower error
                                                probabilities
                                                at about the same security level.</p>
                                            <p> In the NIST competition the only PKE algorithm chosen was Kyber, an IND-CCA2
                                                secure KEM based on the LWE (learning with errors) problem over module lattices,

                                            <p> The roots of the algorithm are in the first ever scheme PKE proposed
                                                by Regev, incorporating improvements proposed in this field, such as
                                                using polynomials instead of integers by integrating Ring-LWE and 
                                                Module-LWE, simmilar to NTRU.</p>
                                            <p> Three variations of the algorithm have been proposed and are undergoing

                                                have the same security as AES-126, AES-192 and AES-256 respectively. The performance
                                                of the algorithm is much better than other NIST competitors.</p>
                                            <p> Kyber has already been integrated into libraries and systems used in the industry,
