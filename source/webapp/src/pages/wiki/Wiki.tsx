                                                when deploying PQC algorithms in reality. Nevertheless, there are still

                                                stronger security against known attacks, enjoys more robust CCA security

                                                respectively.</p>
                                            <p> When compared to the NIST Round 3 finalist Kyber that is based on the

                                            <p> It demonstrates a new approach of decrypting NTRU ciphertext since its
                                                introduction 25 years ago. Instead of introducing an artificial masking
                                                parameter p to decrypt the ciphertext, the algorithm use 2 linear
                                                equations

                                                unknowns to recover the message and the error. The encryption process is
                                                therefore close to the GGH scheme.</p>
                                            <p> However, since the secret key is now a short basis (not a vector), the
                                                algorithm
                                                poses the necessity to modify the decryption algorithm and to come with
                                                a
                                                new
                                                NTRU decoder. Thanks to the improved decoder, the scheme works with a
                                                smaller
                                                modulus and yields shorter ciphertexts, smaller than RSA-4096 for
                                                128-bit
                                                classical security with comparable public-key size and much faster than
                                                RSA
                                                or
                                                even ECC. Meanwhile, the encryption and decryption are still simple and
                                                fast

                                                spite of the complicated key generation.</p>
                                            <p> Overall, this KEM has more compact parameters than all current
